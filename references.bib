  abstract = {The almost 50 million young people aged 10–24 in Nigeria face many challenges
to their sexual and reproductive health (SRH). MyQuestion is a platform that
allows young people to ask SRH questions via text message. Trained counselors
provide responses using a database of answers to frequently asked questions
or customized replies. We analyze the content of more than 300,000 text messages received by the service since 2007 to address three questions: which health
topics are most frequently submitted to the MyQuestion service; what kinds of
questions are asked about these topics; and what language is used to convey
the questions? We find a substantial unmet need for basic SRH information,
with users’ questions communicated in ways that convey considerable confusion, misinformation, and urgency. The analysis can be used to improve similar
Q\&A services and to improve the provision of SRH services for young people
more generally},

  volume = {52},
  issn = {0749-3797},
  doi = {10.1016/j.amepre.2016.10.042},
  abstract = {Context
Existing evidence shows that text message interventions can produce short-term health behavior change. However, understanding is limited regarding intervention characteristics moderating this effect or the long-term effectiveness of text message interventions on behavior change after contact stops.
Evidence acquisition
MEDLINE, PubMed Central, ERIC, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were searched for articles published between April 2008 and December 2014 that evaluated an intervention targeting preventive health behaviors, delivered primarily by text message.
Evidence synthesis
Intervention development and design characteristics and research outcomes were evaluated for 51 studies. Thirty-five studies were included in a meta-analysis (conducted in 2015) examining overall effect size and moderators of effect size. The overall pooled effect of interventions was d=0.24 (95\% CI=0.16, 0.32, p{$<$}0.001) using outcome data collected most proximal to intervention cessation. Seven studies collected data following a no-intervention maintenance period and showed a small but significant pooled maintenance effect (d=0.17, 95\% CI=0.03, 0.31, p=0.017, k=7). Few variables significantly moderated intervention efficacy. Interventions that did not use a theoretic basis, used supplementary intervention components, and had a duration of 6\textendash{}12 months were most effective. The specific behavior being targeted was not associated with differences in efficacy nor was tailoring, targeting, or personalization of text message content.
Conclusions
Text message interventions are capable of producing positive change in preventive health behaviors. Preliminary evidence indicates that these effects can be maintained after the intervention stops. The moderator analysis findings are at odds with previous research, suggesting a need to examine moderators at the behavior-specific level.},

  abstract = {The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved considerably in the last 60 years. While there are now many AI applications that have been deployed in high-income country contexts, use in resource-poor settings remains relatively nascent. With a few notable exceptions, there are limited examples of AI being used in such settings. However, there are signs that this is changing. Several high-profile meetings have been convened in recent years to discuss the development and deployment of AI applications to reduce poverty and deliver a broad range of critical public services. We provide a general overview of AI and how it can be used to improve health outcomes in resource-poor settings. We also describe some of the current ethical debates around patient safety and privacy. Despite current challenges, AI holds tremendous promise for transforming the provision of healthcare services in resource-poor settings. Many health system hurdles in such settings could be overcome with the use of AI and other complementary emerging technologies. Further research and investments in the development of AI tools tailored to resource-poor settings will accelerate realising of the full potential of AI for improving global health.},
